Improve TableView efficiency, i.e. don't reload the entire table when we can do a single row/section instead...


CoreData:
  -make new recipes orphans until completion call back
    -inside RecipeViewController, will need to remember whether we've been inserted yet, and delay adding sub-nodes to the context until the recipe is added...

  -implement reference object stuff...


RecipeViewController:
  -image view
    -give clear indication that you can select a photo when in editting mode
      -when editing, display label above view with text "tap to select photo"?
      -when editing, change default photo to one that says "tap to select photo"?
    -add ability to delete photo without selecting a new one
      -when it editing, display delete button in top right corner?

  -the component textfields of the ingredientTableViewCells should have dynamic lengths

  -as ingredients table view shrinks, steps table view should smoothly follow it up..
    -will require unbinding some layout constraints and animating the frame of the steps table view

  -implement ingredient reordering...


AppDelegate:
  -attempt to convert data store before just deleting it...


implement willGoIntoBackground stuff...
